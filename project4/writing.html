				<p> 
					I am really excited to work on my DP! kinda scared, I fear that this is a really big challenge that I may not have all the skills yet to take on. I was never trained in web design till this winter session, I was never the kid who sat around at a computer when I was little, yet here I am. Sitting at computer, and having a blast. </p>

					<p>The internet as a whole really does not do justice for an illustrator. There art is usually thrown aside, or bound into a really small box, then over powered by adds, a massive scroll of text, and more ads. In all, the internet on a average joe level, is pretty poor design wise. It’s so messy and packed with stuff. every page now is full to the brims with information, and on your “15 inch screen, you can’t read articles in peace. </p>

					<p>What if there was a way to clean all that up, still allow the advertisers to have there add space, and allow the article to be an article. An interactive space, a space where illustration and text can once be reunited, not bound to the conventions.</p>

					<p>I will be addressing editorial design and Illustration in the webspace.
